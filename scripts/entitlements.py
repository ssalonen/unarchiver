"""Verify a signed binary carries the entitlements its target declares.

  entitlements.py check <signed.plist> <declared.entitlements>
      Exit non-zero (with a message) if any key, or any value of an array key,
      declared in the target's .entitlements file is missing from the signed
      set. Also exits non-zero if the declared file is empty or unparseable —
      an empty declared set would otherwise make every check trivially pass.

That last guard is not hypothetical: XcodeGen's `entitlements:` project.yml key
*generates* the plist at the given path, and with no `properties:` it would
overwrite a checked-in .entitlements file with an empty dict on every
`xcodegen generate`, silently signing releases without the declared
capabilities while this check kept reporting OK (comparing the build against
the same emptied file). The declared set is now required to be non-empty.

Zero third-party dependencies by design: the standard library's plistlib only.
